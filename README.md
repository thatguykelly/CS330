1.	How do I approach designing software?

  o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    Learning more about functions, creating and implementing my own. I have more work to do but I recognize areas where a function will help me and the code and     be simpler to implement. Making my code reusable and clean.
  o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I will have to say it wasn’t really mine. I went through the resources and the videos over and over and could pick up on things that worked within the given     code. After getting through to the other side, I was aware of ways to do things different to make it much cleaner.
  o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    This term was a learning process and I think more will be revealed to me in future work. One tactic was research and taking the time to learn about linking,     which is more of a C++ thing but can help in developing OpenGL environments.
    
2.	How do I approach developing programs?

  o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I haven’t had much experience with Visual Studio, and I think that may have burdened me a bit during this term. I researched some information online and         watched some videos just to get a better understanding of the software.
  o	How did iteration factor into your development?
    Within the project that needed multiple objects of say the same size, iteration was there to compute all that within a few lines of code rather than drawing     them 10 times separately. 
  o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
    I can’t even count how many times I had to start over during this term. Whether for an assignment or milestone and eventually the final project. Once errors     were thrown that I understood it helped me with debugging. Earlier I would have errors that were meant to be understood by someone with more experience with     development and Visual Studio. This would create a major roadblock for me during the weeks to get assignments and milestones done.
    
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    As I said previously, this term was a learning adventure. I was able to apply myself to the project at hand. Sometimes restarting 7 times is what it takes. I     just had to immerse myself in the resources, videos and software. This term didn’t come easy by any means.
  o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    Not positive graphics will be in my future as far as OpenGL. Obviously you never know and it could be incorporated into presentations to colleagues,             depending on the scope. Foundational knowledge goes a long way and I know that somewhere down the line I will look back at this term and pull more from the       experience.
